# HTML and CSS
## WEEK 1

# Unit 1: Introduction 
The web or browser programming consists of three parts (HTML, CSS, and JavaScrript), this combination allows the web or browser programming to be resilient to changes in technology. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to structure our webpage. It uses the opening and closing tags (less-than, and greater-than symbols). So far we have introduced some different tags including; p for writing paragraphs, em, i, b, and strong; these tags are used to emphasize or stress some information. We have also covered the tags for making heading h, the heading is named from (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6). Each headline (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6) has a distinct visual effect. The h1 element is the largest and most prominent, while h6 is the smallest and least attention-grabbing. We have also covered the HTML list. There are three types of lists in HTML, these are ordered list ol, unordered list ul, and definition list dl. So far we have covered closing tags. We can also add the quotations on our web q.
