# HTML and CSS
## WEEK 1

# Unit 1: Introduction 
The web or browser programming consists of three parts (HTML, CSS, and JavaScrript), this combination allows the web or browser programming to be resilient to changes in technology. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to structure our webpage. It uses the opening and closing tags (less-than, and greater-than symbols). So far we have introduced some different tags including; p for writing paragraphs, em, i, b, and strong; these tags are used to emphasize or stress some information. We have also covered the tags for making heading h, the heading is named from \<h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6>. Each headline \<h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6> has a distinct visual effect. The h1 element is the largest and most prominent, while h6 is the smallest and least attention-grabbing. We have also covered the HTML list. 

-HTML LIST
There are three types of lists in HTML.
1. ordered list \<ol>
   - The ordered list is used to represent data in a list for which the order of items has significance.
2. unordered list \<ul>
 - The unordered list is used to represent data in a list for which the order of items does not matter
3. definition list \<dl>
   -The HTML description list is used to represent data in the name-value form
   
-HTML Date and Time
   HTML elements can have extra information provided to them via HTML attributes. Here, we can provide the date or time in a manner that computers can comprehend by using the datetime attribute.
   For example, \<time datetime="2025-05-08"> May 8, 2025 \</time> is how we express it. The complete date does not need to be written out on the webpage. While time stamps on webpages sometimes utilize terms like 
  "five hours ago" or "ten days ago," the property actually uses the correct machine-readable version in the background. Highly uniform formats are preferred by machines, and the time element can also be used to 
  denote times. Numbers in the 24-hour clock format are preferred in the machine-readable version, and we have the option of include seconds and fractions of a second.
 -HTML Qoutes
  To attributes the qoute we use tag \<cite> element, and to add distinguish from the sourounding text, we can wrap the whole thing in a blockqoute tag element

# Unit 2: HTML fommating
 HTML formatting can be quite handly for structuring content. \<pre> is used for preformatted text, maintaining whitespaces and line break exactly as they are written in HTMLcode. \<br> is a linebreak tag, used 
 to create a line break un the content. There is no opening or closing tag on the \<br> element, making it a simple tag. It only specifies where a line break should occur; it has nothing inside it. \<Pre> and \<code> elements are often combined to display a code block with proper indentation.

- HTML Superscripts, Subscripts and Small Text
  The  Superscripts, Subscripts and Small Text are used to mark the certain bits of content as having different meaning that than the rest.
  The \<sub> tag is used for subscript, making text appear slightly below the normal line, while the \<sup> tag is used for superscript, positioning text slightly above the normal line. These tags are 
  employed to format text in a way that is either lower or higher than the regular text line, useful for applications such as chemical formulas or mathematical expressions. The \<small> tag in HTML is used to 
 define smaller text, reducing font size. It decreases the font size by one size (from medium to small, from x-large to large). It has a display property of inline. The \<small> tag also supports the Global 
 Attributes and Event Attributes in HTML. This tag is not deprecated, but it is possible to achieve better results or nearly the same effect with CSS.
